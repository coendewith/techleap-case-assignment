## Success Stories

### 1. Israel: The Yozma Program (1993-1998)

**The most successful government VC program in history.**

#### Structure
- Government invested $100M into 10 private VC funds
- Each fund required three partners:
  - Israeli venture capitalists (learning)
  - Foreign VC firm (expertise + networks)
  - Israeli bank (local capital)
- Government took 40% stake with **buyout option at 5 years**

#### Results

| Metric | Before (1991) | After (2000) | Change |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Annual VC investment | $58M | $3.3B | **60x** |
| Startups launched | 100 | 800 | **8x** |
| IT revenues | $1.6B | $12.5B | **8x** |
| Global VC ranking | Low | #2 (behind USA only) | — |

#### Why It Worked
1. **Catalyzed, then exited**: 9/10 funds bought out government stake → full privatization
2. **Knowledge transfer**: Foreign VCs brought expertise, not just money
3. **Aligned incentives**: Buyout option meant private partners wanted success
4. **Didn't pick winners**: Invested in funds, not individual companies

#### Key Quote
> "Israel's model can't be duplicated exactly, but it can be implemented with the right adjustments."

### 2. United Kingdom: SEIS/EIS Tax Incentives

**Made angel investing rational, not gambling.**

#### Structure
- **SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme)**:
  - 50% income tax relief on investments up to £200K/year
  - Capital gains tax exemption if held 3+ years
  - Companies can raise up to £250K

- **EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme)**:
  - 30% income tax relief on investments up to £1M/year
  - Companies can raise up to £5M/year, £12M lifetime

#### Results
- **90%+ of UK angel investments** use SEIS/EIS
- Made UK "one of the most consistently liquid early-stage markets in the world"
- 2024-25: 3,195 SEIS applications (85% approval rate)

#### Why It Worked
1. **Risk mitigation**: Tax relief makes high-risk investing rational
2. **Private-sector driven**: Government doesn't pick winners
3. **Predictable**: Clear rules, not discretionary grants
4. **Aligned with holding period**: 3-year requirement promotes patient capital

#### Key Quote
> "I don't know if I'd have made those investments without SEIS, and going forward I wouldn't invest if a business wasn't registered for the scheme." — Angel investor Patrick Nash

### 3. Singapore: EDB Co-Investment Model

**Strategic government as anchor investor.**

#### Structure
- **SEEDS Capital**: Co-invests with private VCs in early-stage startups
- **EDBI**: Invests in growth-stage companies aligned with national priorities
- **Startup SG**: Grants up to $500K for qualifying startups
- **$750M AI investment** over 5 years (2024-2029)

#### Results
- Jumped to **#4 globally** in 2025 startup ecosystem rankings
- **44.9% ecosystem growth rate** (one of highest globally)
- 73% of Southeast Asia's 2023 tech investment ($6.1B)
- 510 VC firms, 220 incubators, 4,500 tech startups

#### Why It Worked
1. **Co-investment model**: Government follows private VCs, doesn't lead
2. **Strategic sectors**: Focus on AI, fintech, deeptech
3. **Gateway positioning**: "Success in Singapore = gateway to Southeast Asia"
4. **Infrastructure investment**: Computing, cloud, AI resources for startups

## Failure Patterns

### 1. "Picking Winners" Approach

**Problem**: Government allocates based on past performance indicators.

**Result**: Companies that haven't shown success yet get no support—but early-stage is where support matters most.

**Example**: Many European national programs evaluate based on revenue/traction, systematically excluding pre-revenue startups that need help most.

---

### 2. Public Venture Funds (Direct Investment)

**Problem**: Government-run VC funds lack two essential elements:
- Learning networks between entrepreneurs
- Connectivity that private VCs provide

**Result**: Portfolio companies are isolated, miss peer learning and introductions.

**Why**: Government fund managers have different incentives than private VCs (political vs. financial returns).

---

### 3. Grant-Heavy Models

**Problem**: When grants dominate, private incentives distort.

**Evidence from data**: Grant-backed companies in our analysis had **2.8% acquisition rate**—worst of all funding paths (vs. 11.4% for direct-to-venture).

**Mechanism**:
- Grants don't bring smart money (advice, networks)
- No skin in the game from capital provider
- Can create "grant dependency" mindset

---

### 4. Crowding Out Private Capital

**Problem**: Poorly designed public programs substitute for private investment rather than complementing it.

**OECD finding**: "Public programs crowd in private capital when they're professionalized, matched with experienced managers, and disciplined; they crowd out when they substitute politics for underwriting."

---

### 5. Insufficient Resources + Misallocation

**Problem**: Support spread too thin across too many companies.

**Result**: No company gets enough support to make a difference.

**Better approach**: Concentrate resources on companies with validation (3-4 funding rounds in our data = optimal outcomes).

## Netherlands: Current Gaps

### Quantitative Gaps

| Metric | Netherlands | Best Practice | Gap |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Scale-up ratio | 21.5% | USA: 54% | -32.5pp |
| Local funding share | 22% | USA: 78% | -56pp |
| VC per capita | 60% of Sweden | Israel: highest | Large |
| ESOP ranking | Bottom quartile | Israel/USA: top | Large |
| New startups (2024) | -23% YoY | — | Declining |
| Seed→A conversion | 6.2% | Israel: 21.4% | -15.2pp |

### Qualitative Gaps

**Constantijn van Oranje (Techleap):**
> "What's lacking is urgency and ambition; in the Netherlands, we do not have a climate of excellence and fast-growing companies."

### What NL Has Done
- Techleap extended to 2029 with €14.8M
- €200M to European Tech Champions Initiative
- €250M blended finance instrument
- New tax regime for international talent (2027)
- TNO + Techleap + Invest-NL alliance on "Compute"

### What's Still Missing
1. **No SEIS/EIS equivalent**: Angel investing remains high-risk without tax mitigation
2. **No Yozma-style co-investment**: Government doesn't bring foreign VC expertise
3. **ESOP taxation**: Still bottom quartile in Europe
4. **Seed→A bridge**: The 12-24 month post-seed window lacks focused support

## Key Lessons Summary

### How to Succeed

| Principle | Example | Mechanism |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Catalyze, then exit** | Israel Yozma | Buyout option → full privatization |
| **Bring expertise, not just money** | Israel (foreign VC partners) | Knowledge transfer > capital |
| **Make angel investing rational** | UK SEIS/EIS | Tax relief = risk mitigation |
| **Co-invest, don't lead** | Singapore SEEDS | Follow private VCs |
| **Focus on matching** | All successful programs | Quality > quantity |

### How to Fail

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Pick winners | Excludes early-stage companies that need help most |
| Direct government VC | Lacks learning networks + connectivity |
| Grant-heavy model | No smart money, creates dependency |
| Crowd out private | Substitutes rather than complements |
| Spread thin | No company gets enough support |
