## 📋 Executive Summary

This analysis examines **48,163 VC-funded companies** across 9 countries to answer one core question:

> **What can Dutch policymakers do to make the startup ecosystem more competitive?**

We identified **three critical findings** and organized recommendations using a **Continue / Stop / Start** framework.

### 🔴 The Gap
**6.2%**
NL Seed→Series A rate
*(vs 9-21% for peers)*

</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">

### 🟡 The Pattern
**3x**
Higher success with
4+ funding rounds

</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">

### 🟢 The Lesson
**Patience Pays**
Rushing to raise
hurts NL most

</td>

## 🎯 The Core Question

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Sub-Question 1
**What does NL do worse than other countries?**
- Lower Seed→Series A conversion
- Smaller average round sizes
- Fewer companies reach 3+ rounds

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Sub-Question 2
**What can NL change to become more competitive?**
- Learn from Israel's Yozma model
- Implement UK-style tax incentives
- Build bridge funding infrastructure

## 📊 Finding 1: The Graduation Gap

**Dutch startups convert Seed to Series A at half the rate of peers.**

| Region | Seed → Series A Rate | Sample Size |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| 🇮🇱 Israel | **21.0%** | 380 |
| 🇺🇸 USA | **11.1%** | 8,462 |
| 🇪🇺 European Peers (UK/DE/FR) | **9.0%** | 2,108 |
| 🇳🇱 **Netherlands** | **6.2%** | 97 |

<div align="center">

![Graduation Gap](figures/finding1_graduation_gap.png)

</div>

### 💡 Policy Implication
The bottleneck isn't seed funding—it's what happens *after* seed. Dutch startups need better post-seed support to graduate to Series A.

---

## 📊 Finding 2: More Rounds = Better Outcomes

**Companies that complete more funding rounds achieve significantly better exit outcomes.**

| Funding Rounds | Global Acquisition Rate | NL Companies Reaching This |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1+ rounds | 4.8% | 305 (100%) |
| 2+ rounds | 8.2% | 89 (29%) |
| 3+ rounds | 12.1% | 33 (11%) |
| 4+ rounds | 15.7% | 15 (5%) |

<div align="center">

![Rounds Matter](figures/finding2_rounds_matter.png)

</div>

### 💡 Policy Implication
Help Dutch companies *complete* funding rounds, not just start them. The goal should be getting more companies to 3+ rounds.

---

## 📊 Finding 3: Patience Pays — Rushing Hurts NL Most

**Companies that raise funding too quickly underperform—especially in the Netherlands.**

| Bootstrap Period | NL Acquisition Rate | USA Acquisition Rate | Israel Rate |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Rushed (<2 years) | **2.0%** | 8.0% | 8.2% |
| Measured (2-5 years) | 5.1% | 7.8% | 10.5% |
| Patient (5+ years) | 8.3% | 10.1% | 14.2% |

<div align="center">

![Patience Pays](figures/finding3_tortoise_effect.png)

</div>

### 💡 Policy Implication
Don't push founders to raise too early. Programs should encourage building sustainable businesses before seeking VC funding.

### What Worked Elsewhere

<table>
<tr>
<th>Country</th>
<th>Program</th>
<th>Year</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇮🇱 Israel</td>
<td><strong>Yozma Program</strong><br/>Government matched VC investments + brought foreign expertise</td>
<td>1993</td>
<td>60x VC growth by 2000<br/>21% Seed→A conversion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇬🇧 UK</td>
<td><strong>EIS/SEIS Tax Relief</strong><br/>30-50% tax relief for angel investors</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇸🇬 Singapore</td>
<td><strong>SEEDS Capital</strong><br/>Co-investment with private VCs</td>
<td>2017</td>
<td>#4 global startup hub by 2025</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Key Insight
> **Successful countries focused on expertise transfer, not just capital injection.**
>
> Israel's Yozma required foreign VC partners to bring operational expertise. The UK's SEIS created a culture of angel investing. Simply adding money without adding knowledge doesn't work.

## 🗺️ Finding 5: Location Within NL Doesn't Matter

**Regional differences within the Netherlands do not predict startup success.**

| Dutch Region | Companies | Acquisition Rate | Deviation from Average |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Amsterdam Metro | 156 | 5.8% | +0.3% |
| Utrecht | 28 | 7.1% | +1.6% |
| Randstad South | 45 | 4.4% | -1.1% |
| Brabant | 32 | 6.3% | +0.8% |
| East/North | 24 | 4.2% | -1.3% |

### 💡 Policy Implication
Don't focus on geographic redistribution. The problem isn't *where* Dutch startups are located—it's *how* they're supported regardless of location.

## 💰 Funding Intensity: NL vs Global Benchmarks

### Total VC Funding Comparison (2005-2014)

| Country | Total Funding | Companies | Avg per Company |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 🇺🇸 USA | $152.8B | 18,432 | $8.3M |
| 🇨🇳 China | $28.4B | 1,847 | $15.4M |
| 🇬🇧 UK | $12.1B | 2,891 | $4.2M |
| 🇮🇱 Israel | $8.9B | 1,284 | $6.9M |
| 🇩🇪 Germany | $5.2B | 1,456 | $3.6M |
| 🇫🇷 France | $4.1B | 1,108 | $3.7M |
| 🇳🇱 **Netherlands** | $4.0B | 305 | **$13.2M** |

### 💡 Key Insight
Dutch funding *intensity* (per company) is actually competitive. The challenge is volume and follow-on support, not initial check sizes.
