# Policy Recommendations

## 1. Addressing the Seed → Series A Drop-off

**The Problem:** NL converts just 6.2% of Seed-funded companies to Series A, versus 16% in the USA and 21% in Israel. This "Valley of Death" costs the Netherlands approximately 9 potential scale-ups per cohort.

**What Works Elsewhere:**

| Country | Program | Mechanism | Result |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Israel** | Yozma (1993) | $100M fund-of-funds requiring foreign VC partners; government took 40% stake with buyout option | 60x VC growth; 9/10 funds privatized; ecosystem now self-sustaining |
| **USA** | SBIC (1958) | Government-guaranteed loans to private VCs at 2:1 leverage | $53B deployed in FY25; 130K jobs/year |
| **USA** | MassVentures | State co-investment + non-dilutive matching grants | $5B private capital leveraged |

**Recommended Action:** Launch a €100M Yozma-style fund-of-funds that **requires international VC partners**. The foreign expertise and networks—not just capital—are what drive conversion. Include a buyout option to align incentives and ensure eventual privatization.

## 2. Creating a High-Risk, High-Reward Environment

**The Problem:** Dutch investors and founders "play it small"—smaller rounds, fewer rounds, earlier exits. This pattern correlates with lower conversion and exit rates.

**What Works Elsewhere:**

| Country | Policy | Mechanism | Result |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **UK** | SEIS/EIS | 50% tax relief on seed investments; capital gains exemption after 3 years | 90%+ of angel investments use it |
| **USA** | Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) | 100% capital gains exclusion up to $10M on startup equity held 5+ years | Founders and early employees keep more upside |
| **Israel** | R&D Grants (OCS/IIA) | 50% of R&D costs covered; repayable only on commercial success | De-risks experimentation; 2,000+ startups created |

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Dutch SEIS:** Introduce 30-50% income tax relief on seed investments up to €200K/year, with capital gains exemption for 3+ year holdings. This makes early-stage investing *rational* rather than gambling.

2. **Fix ESOP Taxation:** The Netherlands ranks in the bottom quartile for employee stock option taxation. Aligning with USA/Israel standards would help attract and retain talent willing to take startup risk.

3. **Shift from Grants to Smart Capital:** Pure grants create dependency (our data shows grant-heavy companies have lower exit rates). Co-investment models where government follows private VCs—rather than picking winners—produce better outcomes.

## Summary

| Priority | Action | Model | Expected Impact |
|----------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Yozma-style fund-of-funds | Israel | +9 scale-ups/year if conversion reaches 15% |
| 2 | Dutch SEIS tax relief | UK | Unlock private angel capital |
| 3 | ESOP tax reform | USA/Israel | Attract risk-tolerant talent |

**Key Insight:** The problem isn't Dutch founders—they perform equally well once they reach Series B. The bottleneck is Seed→A. Israel and the USA solved this with smart capital structures that bring expertise alongside funding. The Netherlands can do the same.
