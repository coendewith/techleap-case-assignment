# Dutch Startup Ecosystem: What the Data Tells Us

**Briefing for Ministry of Economic Affairs** | January 2026

## The Question

What patterns explain why Dutch startups struggle to scale?

## The Answer: It's Not About Money

Analyzing 48,000 companies globally (305 Dutch), I found three patterns that challenge conventional thinking:

### 1. The Graduation Gap

Dutch Seed→Series A conversion is **6.2%**—below European peers UK/Germany/France (9.0%) and far behind USA (15.8%) and Israel (21.4%). Only 6 of 97 Dutch seed companies reached Series A. The bottleneck isn't seed funding—it's what happens in the 12-24 months after.

### 2. Rounds Matter More Than Amount

Companies with 4+ funding rounds have **2x better acquisition rates** (10.9% vs 5.5%). Each round represents external validation. Companies raising 300x more money see only 4pp better outcomes—capital alone doesn't fix the problem.

### 3. Slow Starters Win

Companies that bootstrapped 3+ years before first funding have **1.6x better outcomes** (9.9% vs 6.3%). This contradicts the "move fast" narrative.

## So What?

**For Policy**: Don't add more seed capital. Focus on the post-seed window (12-24 months) where Dutch startups stall. Better founder-investor matching beats more funding.

**For Founders**: Plan for 24-month runway. Build investor relationships early. Don't rush to raise—validate first.

## What I Can't Tell You

- **Data ends 2014** — ecosystem has changed significantly
- **Small Dutch sample (n=97 seed)** — directional, not definitive
- **No founder data** — team quality may be the actual success driver
- **No exit valuations** — acquisition ≠ good outcome

## Who I'd Want to Talk To

- **Series A investors** — Why do they pass on Dutch seed companies?
- **Founders who failed at Seed→A** — What support was missing?

---

**Core Recommendation**: Help companies complete rounds (better matching), not just get more money.
